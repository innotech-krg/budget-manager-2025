- Implement **comprehensive project budget management** with three-dimensional budget tracking (planned/allocated/consumed) across projects, teams, and suppliers
- **Provide AI-assisted budget insights** with transparent confidence levels, minimum 6-month historical data requirements, and mandatory human validation
- Establish **centralized master data management** with RBAC-controlled taxonomy for teams, suppliers, and project categories, including CSV/JSON import capabilities
- Create **intuitive responsive dashboard** with burn-rate analysis, drill-down functionality, and performance optimization for large datasets
- Ensure **system reliability** of 99% uptime for MVP (with infrastructure scaling path to 99.9% in future phases) including graceful degradation capabilities
- **Successful multi-team adoption** across Design, Content, and Development teams with role-based access control and configurable approval workflows

### Background Context

Budget Manager 2025 addresses critical inefficiencies in financial oversight for multi-disciplinary project teams managing diverse portfolios across Website/Digital projects, Content creation, and Development initiatives. Current manual budget management processes create significant administrative overhead and limited visibility into real-time project financial health.

The application tackles the fundamental challenge of managing complex project-to-budget relationships while accommodating different team workflows, approval processes, and cost structures. Success depends on robust technical architecture including hybrid OCR processing, real-time data synchronization, and scalable infrastructure that can handle the complexity of three-dimensional budget tracking across multiple teams and suppliers. The solution balances intelligent automation with necessary human oversight controls, acknowledging that AI-assisted features require adequate historical data and ongoing model maintenance to deliver reliable insights.

### Technical Dependencies & Infrastructure Requirements

- **External Services:** Cloud OCR APIs (Google Vision/AWS Textract) with fallback capabilities
- **Storage:** File storage for PDF invoices and AI training patterns  
- **Background Processing:** Queue-based system for OCR and AI analysis
- **Caching:** Redis layer for dashboard performance optimization
